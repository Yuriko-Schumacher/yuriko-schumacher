    "description": "I designed and developed a new version of the Texas Tribune's voter guide. The ballot lookup feature provides information about each district's population demographics, voter turnout, and the winning margin of the 2020 presidential election, in addition to displaying ballot information based on a user-entered address. Previously, the Tribune used Mapbox for the static maps included in the tool, which proved costly. To reduce expenses, I created the maps without relying on Mapbox. This is one of the most visited pages of the Tribune's website in 2024.",
