For each of them, I counted the number of NYT articles and total number of words to see which mass shootings have drawn more media attention. To do that, I developed database query conditions, converted formats of data, manually went through more than 6000 articles, and analyzed the cleaned data, with guidance from a researcher Emily Boardman Ndulue.
